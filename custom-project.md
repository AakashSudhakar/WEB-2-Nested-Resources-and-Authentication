# Full Stack 2 Custom Project Spec

## Objectives

1. Build an original multi-resource website yourself.

## Requirements

1. Begin from scratch without any sort of template. You may look at any code you like, 
and copy and paste chunks of other code, but do not duplicate an entire other project.
1. Useful RESTful routing.
1. Your site serves at least three resources. 
1. The project must be shipped live on heroku.
1. A full test suite of controller tests for your routes.
1. A fully responsive, conventionally styled, front end using Bootstrap 3.
1. Had at least one code review from the instructor before the end of the course.

## Options

1. You may use any API you like to integrate into your project.
1. You may work alone or in pairs - if you are going to work in pairs you must 
pair program for 90% of the time - this will mean significant coordination outside 
of class to schedule time to work side-by-side. You will be expected to turn in 
the project together. Pair programed projects are not expected to be more 
feature-full (because pp can be slower than solo programming sometimes), but they 
are expected to demonstrate significantly better code craftsmanship.
1. You may add another resource if you like and look ahead to how to do reference 
and embedded documents.

## Submission

1. Send two links (github and heroku) to your instructor before the final day of class.
