# Authentication

### Objectives

* Explain how a password can be store securely
* Explain and diagram the pattern of authentication that uses sessions and cookies
* Use `passport` to sign up and login to an application

## Background



## Resource

1. [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/)
1. [Your Node.js authentication tutorial is (probably) wrong](https://hackernoon.com/your-node-js-authentication-tutorial-is-wrong-f1a3bf831a46)
1. [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet)

## Challenges

1. Create a new node application that has secure signup, login, and encrypted password storage using `passport`. You can use the [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) to generate a new express app more rapidly (watch out for Jade templates!). Use the `passport-local` [documentation](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) for guidance. You might want to look at this complex [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local) tutorial.

## Stretch Challenges

1. Add Facebook authentication
1. Add Github authentication
